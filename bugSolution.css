Instead of directly using `calc(100% - 10px)` in the nested element, set the parent element's dimensions explicitly (e.g., using `width` and `height` properties or a fixed size). Then, use `calc()` within the child element, and ensure that the calculation is based on the parent element's dimensions. Alternatively, use a CSS preprocessor or a JavaScript solution if more dynamic calculations are needed.
